Fractal-Wavetable-Generator (C)Carl Hudson 2012
===========================

Creates a single-cycle Fractal Wavetable, 256 samples in size, based on four initial parameters.. 
For use as a synthesizer oscillator.


The first three parameters are numbers between 0-255..

The fourth parameter selects which type of calculation takes place.


This generates interesting and experimental fractal wavetables. 
The code here was designed to be run on an Arduino, with
each of the parameters being set by pots.
